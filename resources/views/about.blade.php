                    Church of God Mission International Incorporated was divinely born by the urge of the Holy Spirit
                    with specific instructions of the Lord to Archbishop B.A. Idahosa as stated:
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Raise up an army for me, to go with the gospel to all Nations. Gather together those whom I have
                    called and I will send them with the fire of my spirit. Give my word and your example to many who
                    will go to teach, preach and heal”

                    Church of God Mission International, as it known today, grew from a very humble beginning in 1962 as a
                    prayer group first named Calvary Fellowship at a shop on Ivbizua Street, off Mission Road. It was
                    officially inaugurated in 1965 by Rev. Edgar Perkins. On October 26th 1968, Rev. Perkins approached the
                    Assemblies of God to release Benson Idahosa, then a Sunday School Superintendent, to oversee the prayer
                    ministry. The fellowship moved to No. 26, Forestry Road, Benin City with Pastor Benson Idahosa fully
                    in-charge. The membership of the fellowship grew numerically. Pastor Benson Idahosa decided to build a
                    church and this began his building ministry.

                <p> He moved the members to Iyaro Church and on 18th of September, 1974. The church was registered under the
                    Land perpetual succession Acts and Certificate number 1245 was issued. By the time Church of God Mission
                    Iyaro was completed the membership had risen tremendously. The church was declared opened by Papa Gordon
                    Lindsay and Papa Elton. </p>
                <p>Church of God’s primary ministry was evangelism-Living up to her motto: Evangelism our Supreme Task, the
                    church engaged in street evangelism and open air crusades. Through these activities souls were daily
                    added to the church and everywhere papa went with the gospel churches were planted and solid structures
                    erected. </p>
                <p>In keeping with his belief of a ministry building that keeps up with the times, and to accommodate the
                    influx of converts, the Archbishop laid the foundation of another church called Miracle Centre, on
                    airport road, Benin City on Saturday 1st December, 1973 which was dedicated on Sunday 9th November, 1975
                    by Mrs. Freda Lindsay.</p>
                <p>The continued growth of the ministry led to the building of Faith Miracle Centre auditorium, which many
                    refer to as a marvel and was a vision fulfilled. In 1983, in far away Australia, the Archbishop heard
                    God told him to build Him a building that will bring glory and honour to his name. The auditorium which
                    is believed to seat over twenty thousand people was the first stadium church in Africa. It was dedicated
                    and opened on 2nd November, 1986. Coinciding with the growth of churches in Benin was the planting of
                    branches. Today Church of God Mission International has presence in all parts of Nigeria and the world
                    over. </p>
                <p>The ministry has developed infrastructures to strengthen her ability to fulfill her mandate preparing an
                    army to rescue humanity for God. This she had done through the establishment of a viable Bible School –
                    All Nations for Christ Bible Institute, to fulfill the educational need for pastors and contribute to
                    building a vibrant society. The ministry has schools ranging from pre-Nursery (Word of Faith Group of
                    Schools) to the university (Benson Idahosa University) and also functional medical facilities (Faith
                    Mediplex Group of Hospitals) for all people. The ministry is resolved in her quest to produce whole
                    persons in Spirit, soul and body.</p>
